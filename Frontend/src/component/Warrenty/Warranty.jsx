            <p>
              At Nexxa, we stand behind the quality of our products. This warranty covers defective components and incorrectly shipped items.
              Our warranty is strictly parts-only â€” labor costs are not covered under any circumstance.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Replacement and Refund Policy</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>If a part is found to be defective, we will first attempt to provide a replacement.</li>
              <li>If a replacement is not available, we will issue a full refund for the purchase price.</li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>Return shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer and will not be reimbursed.</li>
              <li>When contacting Nexxa regarding a return, please include a detailed explanation of the reason for return.</li>

              <li>Returned parts that do not meet warranty criteria may be subject to a 25% restocking fee, and shipping costs may be deducted from the refund.</li>
              <li>Items ordered for testing purposes or incorrectly ordered by the customer are not eligible for return.</li>
              <li>Please confirm compatibility with your mechanic or body shop before purchasing.</li>

            <h2>6. Engines</h2>
            <p>
              Engines are sold as complete assemblies, which may include manifolds, oil pans, timing belts, covers, and fuel systems.
              However, the warranty covers only the long block (engine block, cylinder head, and internal components).
            </p>
            <p>The following items are not covered unless purchased separately:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Turbos</li>
              <li>Starters</li>
              <li>Air compressors</li>

              <li>Optical distributors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              High-wear components such as water pumps, distributor caps, spark plugs, wires, gaskets, seals, and timing chains may need to be replaced before installation and are not covered under warranty.

            <h2>7. Transmissions</h2>
            <p>
              All transmissions are guaranteed to shift properly and have good gears and bearings.
              Before installation, the following steps must be taken to maintain warranty coverage:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Thoroughly clean the transmission and oil pan.</li>
              <li>Replace all seals and gaskets.</li>
              <li>Change oil and filter in automatic transmissions.</li>
              <li>Flush and test the cooler and lines for proper flow.</li>
              <li>Fully seat the torque converter in the front pump.</li>
              <li>
                For manual transmissions: replace the clutch, pressure plate, and slave cylinder, and resurface the flywheel.
              </li>
              <li>Fill with proper fluid and check levels carefully.</li>
